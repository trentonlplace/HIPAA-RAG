### Deploy instructions
<br/>

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important: Check Azure OpenAI Quota Availability**
 <br/>To ensure sufficient quota is available in your subscription, please follow [quota check instructions guide](./docs/QuotaCheck.md) before you deploy the solution.

<br/>
The "Deploy to Azure" button offers a one-click deployment where you don‚Äôt have to clone the code. If you would like a developer experience instead, follow the [local deployment instructions](./docs/LOCAL_DEPLOYMENT.md).

Once you deploy to Azure, you will have the option to select PostgreSQL or Cosmos DB, see screenshot below.

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure-Samples%2Fchat-with-your-data-solution-accelerator%2Frefs%2Fheads%2Fmain%2Finfra%2Fmain.json)

Select either "PostgreSQL" or "Cosmos DB":
![Solution Architecture - DB Selection](/docs/images/db_selection.png)


When Deployment is complete, follow steps in [Set Up Authentication in Azure App Service](./docs/azure_app_service_auth_setup.md) to add app authentication to your web app running on Azure App Service

**Note**: The default configuration deploys an OpenAI Model "gpt-4.1" with version 2025-04-14. However, not all
locations support this version. If you're deploying to a location that doesn't support version 2024-05-13, you'll need to
switch to a lower version. To find out which versions are supported in different regions, visit the
[GPT-4.1 Model Availability](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models?tabs=global-standard%2Cstandard-chat-completions#global-standard-model-availability) page.

### Testing the deployment
1. Navigate to the admin site, where you can upload documents. It will be located at:

    `https://web-{RESOURCE_TOKEN}-admin.azurewebsites.net/`

    Where `{RESOURCE_TOKEN}` is uniquely generated during deployment. This is a combination of your subscription and the name of the resource group. Then select **Ingest Data** and add your data. You can find sample data in the `/data` directory.

    ![A screenshot of the admin site.](./docs/images/admin-site.png)


2. Navigate to the web app to start chatting on top of your data. The web app can be found at:

    `https://web-{RESOURCE_TOKEN}.azurewebsites.net/`
