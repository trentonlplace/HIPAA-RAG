# HIPAA-RAG Architecture Baseline

## Current System Architecture

### Overview
The Chat with Your Data Solution Accelerator is a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system that enables natural language querying over private documents. The system processes, stores, and retrieves potentially sensitive health information, requiring full HIPAA compliance.

### Current Architecture Components

#### 1. Frontend Layer
- **Technology**: React 18.3.1 with TypeScript
- **Hosting**: Azure App Service
- **Security Concerns**: 
  - User authentication and session management
  - Client-side data handling
  - HTTPS enforcement required

#### 2. API Layer
- **Technology**: Flask with async support (Python 3.10+)
- **Hosting**: Azure App Service
- **Components**:
  - `code/backend/api/chat_history.py` - Conversation management
  - Authentication middleware
  - Rate limiting and input validation
- **Security Concerns**:
  - API authentication and authorization
  - Input sanitization for PHI
  - Request/response logging

#### 3. Admin Interface
- **Technology**: Streamlit
- **Hosting**: Azure App Service  
- **Components**:
  - Document upload interface
  - Data exploration tools
  - System configuration
- **Security Concerns**:
  - Administrative access controls
  - Document upload security
  - Configuration management

#### 4. Document Processing Pipeline
- **Technology**: Azure Functions (Python)
- **Components**:
  - `batch_start_processing.py` - Document ingestion
  - `batch_push_results.py` - Processing results
  - `add_url_embeddings.py` - Web content processing
  - `get_conversation_response.py` - Response generation
- **Security Concerns**:
  - Document parsing and extraction
  - Temporary file handling
  - Processing queue security

#### 5. Data Storage Layer
- **Azure Blob Storage**: Original document storage
- **Azure AI Search**: Vector embeddings and search index
- **Database Options**:
  - PostgreSQL with pgvector (primary)
  - Azure Cosmos DB (alternative)
- **Security Concerns**:
  - Encryption at rest
  - Access controls
  - Data retention policies

#### 6. AI/ML Services
- **Azure OpenAI**: GPT models and embeddings
- **Azure Document Intelligence**: Text extraction
- **Azure AI Search**: Semantic search
- **Security Concerns**:
  - Model data handling
  - API key management
  - Request logging

### Current Data Flow

1. **Document Ingestion**:
   ```
   User Upload → Blob Storage → Processing Queue → Azure Functions
   ```

2. **Document Processing**:
   ```
   Document Intelligence → Chunking → Embedding → Search Index + Database
   ```

3. **Query Processing**:
   ```
   User Query → Search Retrieval → LLM Generation → Response + Citations
   ```

4. **Conversation Storage**:
   ```
   Chat Messages → Database (PostgreSQL/Cosmos) → Chat History
   ```

## HIPAA Compliance Gap Analysis

### Current Compliance Status: NON-COMPLIANT

#### Administrative Safeguards - NOT IMPLEMENTED
- [ ] Security Officer designation
- [ ] Workforce training programs
- [ ] Information access management procedures
- [ ] Security awareness training
- [ ] Security incident procedures
- [ ] Contingency plan
- [ ] Risk assessment procedures
- [ ] Business Associate Agreements

#### Physical Safeguards - PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
- [x] Azure datacenter physical security (inherited)
- [ ] Workstation access controls
- [ ] Device and media controls
- [ ] Facility access controls documentation

#### Technical Safeguards - PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
- [ ] Access control (unique user identification, automatic logoff, encryption)
- [ ] Audit controls and logging
- [ ] Integrity controls
- [ ] Person or entity authentication
- [ ] Transmission security (end-to-end encryption)

### Critical Security Gaps

#### 1. Data Encryption
**Current State**: Basic HTTPS for transmission, Azure storage encryption
**Required**: End-to-end encryption, customer-managed keys, field-level encryption for PHI

#### 2. Access Controls
**Current State**: Basic authentication
**Required**: Role-based access control, multi-factor authentication, audit logging

#### 3. Audit Logging
**Current State**: Basic application logging
**Required**: Comprehensive audit trails, tamper-proof logs, 7-year retention

#### 4. Data Classification
**Current State**: No PHI identification or handling
**Required**: Automatic PHI detection, data classification, secure handling workflows

#### 5. Network Security
**Current State**: Standard Azure networking
**Required**: Virtual network isolation, private endpoints, network monitoring

## HIPAA Compliance Requirements

### Data Classification Requirements
- Automatic PHI detection in documents
- Data labeling and classification
- Secure PHI handling workflows
- De-identification processes

### Encryption Requirements
- **At Rest**: AES-256 encryption with customer-managed keys
- **In Transit**: TLS 1.3 minimum for all communications
- **In Processing**: Encrypted memory and temporary storage
- **Database**: Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) with customer keys

### Access Control Requirements
- Multi-factor authentication for all users
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Principle of least privilege
- Regular access reviews
- Automatic session timeouts

### Audit and Logging Requirements
- Comprehensive audit trails for all PHI access
- Tamper-proof log storage
- Real-time security monitoring
- 7-year log retention
- Regular audit reports

### Data Backup and Recovery
- Encrypted backups with geographic redundancy
- Regular backup testing
- Disaster recovery procedures
- Recovery time objectives (RTO) < 4 hours
- Recovery point objectives (RPO) < 1 hour

### Network Security Requirements
- Virtual network isolation
- Private endpoints for all Azure services
- Network segmentation
- DDoS protection
- Web Application Firewall (WAF)

## Risk Assessment Summary

### High Risk Areas
1. **Document Processing Pipeline**: Handles raw PHI documents
2. **Vector Database**: Stores PHI embeddings
3. **Conversation History**: Contains PHI queries and responses
4. **Admin Interface**: Direct access to all system data
5. **API Endpoints**: External attack surface

### Medium Risk Areas
1. **Frontend Application**: Client-side PHI handling
2. **Azure Functions**: Temporary PHI processing
3. **Blob Storage**: Encrypted but needs key management
4. **Search Index**: PHI metadata exposure

### Low Risk Areas
1. **Infrastructure Components**: Standard Azure services
2. **Monitoring Services**: No direct PHI access
3. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Code deployment only
